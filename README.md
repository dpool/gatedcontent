# dpool Gatedcontent extension

## What it does
Gatedcontent is lead-capture extension for TYPO3. The extension provides editors with a configurable form element to collect user data. In exchange for personal information like e-mail address, name, company etc., visitors can access downloads or a single TYPO3 page. Those assets cannot be accessed directly, by passing on a link or by any other short-cut by-passing registration.

## Installation
Install the extension using composer: `composer req dpool/gatedcontent`.
